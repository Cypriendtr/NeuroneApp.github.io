        <h3>Here is some information about the Hodgkin and Huxley model :</h3>

        <article class="info-article">
            This model originated in the 1950s from the work of the two researchers, 
                  Hodgkin and Huxley, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 
                  1963. In their article published in 1952, they studied the generation of action potentials 
                  in the axon of a giant squid.
